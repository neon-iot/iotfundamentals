# 2 - Overview of the Internet of Things

## About this module
This module first analyzes IoT from different perspectives and actors in order to agree on how IoT can be defined. Secondly, the history of IoT is presented to understand its origin and evolution related to RFID technology. Besides, different concepts such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are discussed and related to IoT, higlighting their commonalities and differences. Finally, IoT top application areas are presented with some examples for each one of them.

## Outline
* Lecture [slide deck](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/blob/main/slides/2-Overview.pdf)
* Activity (Project 1/3): Each participant proposes a solution based on IoT to a specific problem. The problem must be clearly defined and their current solutions commented to understand how IoT can provide a better solution. In particular, in this last point it is necessary to identify the different data sources that are needed as well as possible actions that must be carried out, the location of the sources, the frequency with which it is expected to be able to access them, the ranges of expected values, etc. Technological aspects should NOT be considered at this stage, but the problem and its solution must be defined independently of technology.
* Panel: Each project is shared through a collaborative space (wall, board) fostering the discussion among students to improve each proposed idea. Potential tools than can be used for this purpose are [Padlet](https://padlet.com) or [Miro](https://miro.com)
