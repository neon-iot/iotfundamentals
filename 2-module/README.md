# 2 - Rise of the Internet of Things

## About this module
This module first analyzes IoT from different perspectives and actors in order to agree on how IoT can be defined. Secondly, the history of IoT is presented to understand its origin and evolution related to RFID technology. Besides, different concepts such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are discussed and related to IoT, higlighting their commonalities and differences. Finally, IoT top application areas are presented with some examples for each one of them.

## Outline
* Lecture [slide deck](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/blob/main/slides/2-Overview.pdf)
* Activity: Students are proposed to search and investigate different relevant events that can be used to track the evolution of IoT from its early days till today. A collaborative timeline project is created (for example, using [Timetoast](https://www.timetoast.com)) and students work together to populate a timeline with theur findings. Each student should at least propose three events.
* Project: Each student describes an IoT *functional solution* to the problem defined in the previous [module](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/tree/main/1-module). This solution does not consider any technological aspects but only functional ones related to *what* the solution should do, but not yet *how* it should do it. In particular, students shall identify the different data sources that are needed as well as possible actions that must be carried out, the location of the sources, the frequency with which it is expected to be able to access them, the ranges of expected values, etc. Each project is shared through a collaborative space (wall, board) fostering the discussion among students to improve each proposed idea. Potential tools than can be used for this purpose are [Padlet](https://padlet.com) or [Miro](https://miro.com)
