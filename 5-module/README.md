# 5 - Data Communication in the Internet of Things

## About this module
This module addresses the different communication technologies avaiulable to connect IoT nodes to the network infrastructure, mainly considering wireless technologies. The main focus is to understand the tradeoffs behind these technologies to identify best options for each scenario. Besides, data collection and exchange is analyzed by means of IoT management platforms that offer services to interact with IoT nodes and their data, providing visualization tools used to design and offer dahsboards.

## Outline
* Lecture [slide deck](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/blob/main/slides/5-Communication.pdf) 
* Activity: Student shall connect a device (we recommend their phones) to an IoT platform and design a dashboard where they can visualize some data from the sensors that the device has. To carry out this activity, we recommend to use the [AllThingsTalk](https://www.allthingstalk.com) platform that, in addition to offering a free basic plan, allows you to connect a phone to the platform with a [few steps](https://www.allthingstalk.com/faq/try-our-iot-platform-with-your-smartphone-as-an-iot-device) and set up a [dashboard](https://www.allthingstalk.com/faq/smartphone-demo-in-also-iot-platform) where you can view some of its data. 
* Project: Each student shall complete their project addressing the different communication technologies required by theri solution and how data would be visualized in a dashboard. It is expected that different technologies for connectivity are compared and analyzed to identify best options. A dashboard mockup can be designed and presented to demonstrate data visualization.
