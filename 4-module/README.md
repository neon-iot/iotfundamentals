# 4 - Nodes of the Internet of Things

## About this module
This module aims at understanding main components inside an IoT node, without yet considering communication ones which are adressed in the next module. In particular, the module first introduces different interfaces for connecting sensors and actuators as well as memory technologies for storing data temporally inside the node. Control and processing tasks are addressed by analyzing mainly microcontrollers and different commercial available products. Finally, energy requirements are discussed by the use of batteries and protection requierements by the identification of dust and liquid protection levels.

## Outline
* Lecture [slide deck](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/blob/main/slides/4-Nodes.pdf)
* Activity: Watch the following videos that describe how IoT is used in detail to solve specific problems: Can you identify IoT nodes in each case? List potential components inside these nodes.

 * Project: Each student shall update their projects by describing the different resources required by their nodes. In particular, it is expected that students analyze sensor interfaces, microcontrollers, batteries and protection cases for theri project. This update to the project is shared through a collaborative space (wall, board) fostering the discussion among students to improve each proposed idea. Potential tools than can be used for this purpose are [Padlet](https://padlet.com) or [Miro](https://miro.com)
