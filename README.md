# Fundamentals of Internet of Things
## About this teaching material
This teaching material introduces the main concepts behind the Internet of Things (IoT) through the analysis of real world problems where IoT solutions have been proposed. A top-down approach is used to first understand the required interaction of the "thing" with the physical world in terms of data collection and/or action control. This interaction is then analyzed from inside the "thing" to discuss the main components of typical IoT nodes (interfaces, memory, microcontrollers, batteries, etc.) and design trade-offs. Different commercial solutions are reviewed and compared to understand which ones are more suitable for specific applications. Finally, network interaction is considered, which deals with data processing and transfer requirements of IoT nodes to implement a given solution. Different scenarios are analyzed to understand the role of communications technologies in terms of transfer rate, reach and  power consumption.  

## Main topics
* Use cases and applications of IoT technology
* Definition and historical evolution of IoT
* Interaction with the physical world using sensors and actuators
* Device architecture and its main components
* Data processing and transfer technologies
* Data collection and storage platforms
* Data analysis and visualization tools

## What you will learn
* Identify real world problems where IoT can offer a valuable solution
* Analyze required interaction between the IoT device and the physical world
* Select sensors and actuators to accomplish a required interaction
* Define device tasks and their trade-off in terms of energy, storage and cost
* Determine best communication technologies for required distances and rates
* Configure and manage devices using a network platform
* Design and implement dashboard to visualize and analyze data and trigger actions 

## What you will need:
* Access to the Internet through a computer
* Basic programming skills in Python (preferable but not mandatory)
