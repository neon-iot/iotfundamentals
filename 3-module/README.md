# 3 - Sensors and Actuators of the Internet of Things

## About this module
This module focus on the interaction capabilities of IoT with the physycal workd through their sensors and actuators. First, sensors are analyzed and most common introduced. Secondly, actuators are described and most common ones are explained.

## Outline
* Lecture [slide deck](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/blob/main/slides/3-Interaction.pdf)
* Activity: Find out the sensors and actuators your phone has. Consider searching for your phone's specification in first place and then using one of the following apps to get details:
  - Android [Sensor Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exatools.sensors&hl=en_US&gl=US)
  - iOS [Sensors Toolbox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sensors-toolbox/id1242203428)

  Students must discuss and present their findings to the folllowing questions: 
  - What sensors does your phone have? Can you get their model name and main parameters (resolutions, range, etc)?
  - Are you able to get data from any of these sensors and plot them in time?
  - What actuators does your phone have? Can you identify at leats three of them?
