# 3 - Sensors and Actuators of the Internet of Things

## About this module
This module focus on the interaction capabilities of IoT with the physycal workd through their sensors and actuators. First, sensors are analyzed and most common introduced. Secondly, actuators are described and most common ones are explained.

## Outline
* Lecture: [slide deck](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/blob/main/slides/3-Interaction.pdf)
* Activity: Find out the sensors and actuators your phone has. Consider searching for your phone's specification in first place and then using one of the following apps to get details:
  - Android [Sensor Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exatools.sensors&hl=en_US&gl=US)
  - iOS [Sensors Toolbox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sensors-toolbox/id1242203428)

  Students must discuss and present their findings to the folllowing questions: 
  - What sensors does your phone have? Can you get their model name and main parameters (resolutions, range, etc)?
  - Are you able to get data from any of these sensors and plot them in time?
  - What actuators does your phone have? Can you identify at leats three of them?  

* Project: Each student describes a first IoT *specific solution* considering the functional one proposed in the previous module. This first solution mainly adresses the specification of required sensors and actuators for their solution. It is expected that students investigate different sensor and actuators that are commercially available and undertsand if they can use them to get the expected interaction required by their solution. This first technical project is shared through a collaborative space (wall, board) fostering the discussion among students to improve each proposed idea. Potential tools than can be used for this purpose are [Padlet](https://padlet.com) or [Miro](https://miro.com)
