# 1 - Introduction to Internet of Things

## About this module
This module introduces the Internet of Things as a set of technologies with the potential to solve real world problems, improve our lives and sustain world development. The main goal is to motivate students to further investigate where IoT is currently used (applications) and what is the technology behind it. 

## Outline
* Lecture [slide deck](https://github.com/neon-iot/iotfundamentals/blob/main/slides/1-Introduction.pdf)

* Activity: The following IoT solutions to real-world problems are presented, each one can be assigned to a group of students:
  - [Smart Metering](https://demo.thingsboard.io/dashboard/3a1026e0-83f6-11e7-b56d-c7f326cba909?publicId=322a2330-7c36-11e7-835d-c7f326cba909)
